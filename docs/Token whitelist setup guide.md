# Token Whitelist Command User Guide for Beginners

## What is This About?

New to Discord bots and token whitelists? No worries! A token whitelist is a list that grants certain members in your Discord server special access to claim a specific token. This token could be anything from a utility token to a governance token within a blockchain ecosystem.

The `token_wl` command is a handy tool that helps you set up this whitelist. You'll need Administrator permissions to use it.

## How Do I Use This Command?

To use the `token_wl` command, type:

\`\`\`
/setup token_wl [arguments]
\`\`\`

### What Do the Arguments Mean?

#### Required Arguments:

- **channel_mention**: Mention the channel where you want the bot to display the whitelist information. 
- **blockchain**: Choose the blockchain on which the token resides.
- **token_name**: Enter the name of the token you're whitelisting.
- **description**: Provide details about what the token is and why it's being whitelisted.
- **days_available**: Specify for how many days the whitelist should be available.

#### Optional Arguments:

Don't worry, the bot will tell you if something didn't work, and why.

### How Will I Know if It Worked?

The bot will send a follow-up message confirming the successful addition of the token whitelist.
